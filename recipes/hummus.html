    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your dry chickpeas to a bowl and submerge them in water. Let them soak and hydrate over night.</li>
        <li>Remove the water and transfer the chickpeas to a large pot. By now the chickpeas should have doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Submerge the chickpeas in the pot with clean water. Turn the stove up to a high heat and bring the water a light bubble.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of baking soda to accelerate the cooking process. Do not add to much or it will give your hummus a bitter taste.</li>
        <li>As the chickpeas begin to cook, foam will start rising to the top. Remove the foam.</li>
        <li>When the water starts to vigorously bubble, drop the temperature to low and let the chickpeas cook for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once the chickpeas are cooked they should be nice and tender. You can confirm by taking one chickpeas and if it easly mashed between your fingers they are ready.</li>
        <li>Transfer your cooked chickpeas to a new container and store them in the freezer until frozen.</li>
        <li>Add your frozen chickpeas to a food processor.</li>
        <li>Add the sesame paste to the food processor.</li>
        <li>Before add the rest of the ingredients, give the food processor a quick pulse, and then scrape the remainnig off the sides of the food processor.At this point it will still be dry and clumpy.</li>
        <li>To the food processor, add the juice of 1 lemon, 1 teaspoon of cold water, and a generous pinch of salt. Blend the contents till the hummus is smooth.</li>
        <li>Plate your hummus and create a crater in the middle of the hummus. This is where you will add your beef.</li>
        <li>In a scorching hot pan add the ghee.</li>
        <li>Once the ghee is sizzling, add the beef (cubed pieces are easier to eat).</li>
        <li>Add a hefty pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is cooked and has a nice glaze, add the contents of the pan (the beef and ghee) to the crater made in the hummus.</li>
    </ol>
