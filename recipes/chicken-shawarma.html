    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shawarma is a popular street food dish originating from the Middle East. It consists of spiced meats (chicken or beef) that are stacked vertically on a rotisserie with think slices shaved off as it rotates; however, shawarma can also be cooked on your good old cast iron pan. It is usually paired with Toum which is a garlic sauce spread. Shawarma can be fully customized to your liking in regards to toppings (pickles, cucumber, tomato etc.). Today we will be making a Chicken Shawarma with a side of Toum and Fries. </p>

        <li>1.5 Tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup Neutral Oil (ie. Canola Oil or Vegetable Oil)</li>
        <li>2 Ounces Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>2-3 Ounces of Garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Toum</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large container add the garlic cloves and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Add half of the neutral oil to the container.</li>
        <li>Blend everything together.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the rest of the oil and lemon juice to the container. Blend until beautifully creamy. </li>
        <li>Let the Toum rest in the fridge until it is ready to be eaten.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chicken Shawarma</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add and mix your spice mix.</li>
        <li>To the spices add the olive oil and squeeze in the juice of 1 lemon. Thoroughly mix together the contents of the bowl. This will be the marinade for the chicken.</li>
        <li>Slice your chicken thighs into half-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>>Add the sliced chicken to the marinade and thoroughly mix. Let it sit for at least an hour to let the chicken soak in all the flavors. The longer you let it sit the better.</li>
        <li>Get your cast-iron pan on the stove and set the heat to high.</li>
        <li>Once your pan is hot, start to cook the chicken in batches. If you overcrowd the pan you won't get the char that Chicken Shawarma should have. Remove the chicken from the pan once it has cooked.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and remove the pan from the stove. Add your pita to the pan to let it soak up all the flavors.</li>
        <li>Place the pita on parchment paper. Spread the Toum on the pita.Place the chicken on top of the Toum spread. Add slices of your preffered pickle. Wrap everything in side the pita. Wrap your shawarma in the parchment paper tightly. And then wrap that into a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Put the pan back on the heat. Put your Chicken Shawarma (wrapped in parchment and then foil on the outside) in the pan and toast it lightly.</li>
    </ol>
